# calculator_using_lambda


This is a simple Calculator program built in Python using Lambda Functions. The program performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

Features

Addition: Adds two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
Division: Divides the first number by the second.
Error Handling: Returns "invalid" if the operator is incorrect.

No external libraries are required as this project uses basic Python functions.


Code Structure

Lambda Functions: The program uses lambda functions to define the operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Input and Output: The program accepts user input for two numbers and an operator, performs the corresponding arithmetic operation, and prints the result.
